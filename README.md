### Basics of Neural Networks

Neural networks, inspired by the human brain, operate through layers – input, hidden, and output – processing data to produce outcomes. This section simplifies the explanation for a non-technical audience ([Dorschel, 2019](https://medium.com/luminovo/data-privacy-in-machine-learning-a-technical-deep-dive-f7f0365b1d60)).
---
### Neural Networks and Personalization

Our personalization algorithms rely on neural networks to analyze user data and provide tailored recommendations. This section explores the ethical considerations surrounding the use of neural networks in personalization ([Spillane, 2022](https://www.business2community.com/customer-experience/how-gdpr-can-undermine-personalization-and-user-experience-02108269)).
---
### GDPR and Personalization

Summarizing GDPR principles affecting personalization, this section emphasizes transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, and accountability ([Ved, 2019](https://techgdpr.com/blog/develop-artificial-intelligence-ai-gdpr-friendly/)).
---
### Legal Concerns and Data Collection

The application of neural networks introduces legal concerns under GDPR, particularly regarding transparency and accountability. The 'black box' nature of our algorithms may conflict with GDPR's insistence on providing meaningful information about automated decision-making ([Ved, 2019](https://techgdpr.com/blog/develop-artificial-intelligence-ai-gdpr-friendly/)).
---
### Proposed Adaptations for GDPR Compliance

Drawing on current trends in AI and machine learning aimed at privacy preservation, this section proposes changes to data collection, storage, and usage, aligning with GDPR principles ([Dorschel, 2019](https://medium.com/luminovo/data-privacy-in-machine-learning-a-technical-deep-dive-f7f0365b1d60); [Ved, 2019](https://techgdpr.com/blog/develop-artificial-intelligence-ai-gdpr-friendly/)).
---
### Tools and Methods for Data Protection

This section draws on Ved (2019) to present tools and methods categorized into reducing the need for training data, upholding data protection, and addressing the 'black box' issue.
---
### Conclusion

The convergence of AI and GDPR necessitates a thoughtful balance between innovation and privacy ([Dorschel, 2019](https://medium.com/luminovo/data-privacy-in-machine-learning-a-technical-deep-dive-f7f0365b1d60)). Implementing recommended adaptations will position our company to navigate this intersection successfully, ensuring compliance while maintaining a personalized user experience.
